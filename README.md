# [Project 1: Customer Segmentation and Marketing Campaign Analysis](https://github.com/andreavecchi1996/Customer_Segmentation_and_Marketing_Campaign_Analysis.git)
In this project, I performed an end-to-end analysis of a customer marketing dataset sourced from Kaggle. The objective was to explore customer profiles, analyse purchasing behaviour, and evaluate the effectiveness of past marketing campaigns.
I used SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory queries, focusing on customer segmentation based on age, income, family composition, and spending patterns.

For visualisation, I built interactive dashboards in Power BI to display key insights such as customer clusters, product preferences, and campaign response rates.

Key steps included:

* Data cleaning and preparation using SQL queries

* Customer profiling based on demographics and purchase history

* RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for segmentation

* Visualisation of insights through dynamic Power BI dashboards
